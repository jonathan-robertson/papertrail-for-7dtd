# Papertrail for 7 Days to Die

7 Days to Die Modlet: Allow seamless integration between 7DTD’s logging system and Papertrail. All logging that already exists in 7 Days to Die will be automatically forwarded to Papertrail for recording and viewing to help track down bugs, monitor player activity, or provide support to users.

This modlet is based off [jschieck](https://github.com/jschieck)'s [Papertrail Unity SDK](https://github.com/jschieck/papertrailunitysdk).

If interested in using Papertrail within a Unity Project you're developing, I'd encourage you to check out [the blog post](https://blog.papertrailapp.com/improve-live-ops-for-games-using-papertrail/) since it goes into more detail about how this Unity SDK works.
