# Papertrail for 7 Days to Die

[![Tested with A20.3 b3](https://img.shields.io/badge/A20.3%20b3-tested-blue.svg)](https://7daystodie.com/)

7 Days to Die Modlet: Allow seamless integration between 7DTDâ€™s logging system and Papertrail. All logging that already exists in 7 Days to Die will be automatically forwarded to Papertrail for recording and viewing to help track down bugs, monitor player activity, or provide support to users.

## Setup

See the [project readme](PapertrailFor7DTD/README.md), which will also be included within the modlet download.

## Credits

This modlet is based off [jschieck](https://github.com/jschieck)'s [Papertrail Unity SDK](https://github.com/jschieck/papertrailunitysdk).

If interested in using Papertrail within a Unity Project you're developing, I'd encourage you to check out [the blog post](https://blog.papertrailapp.com/improve-live-ops-for-games-using-papertrail/) since it goes into more detail about how this Unity SDK works.
